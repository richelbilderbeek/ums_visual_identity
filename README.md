## FAQ

### Why is this repository not part of [https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace](https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace)?

Because I cannot create repositories with 
[https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace](https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace)
as the owner.

I will transfer this repository to there soon.

### Why does this repository exist?

Because the Google Drive that holds the same content
(except for `TBD_Makerspace_end2.6.ai`) is not findable.

This repository exists so that the Uppsala Makerspace logo and font
can be found by googling.

### Why is `TBD_Makerspace_end2.6.ai` missing?

`TBD_Makerspace_end2.6.ai` is an Adobe Illustrator file of 160+ megabyte,
that cannot be compressed much more. GitHub has a maximum commit size of
100 megabyte, hence it cannot be uploaded.

It can be found in
[the DropBox 'Visuell Identitet'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/122EPqMNJmVir2WNqwvGyMFmBRC7H6e4o?usp=sharing_eil&ts=68d190bf).
